# Handwritten Digit Recognition 🖊️

**Final Year Project** | **Machine Learning** | **Python, TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV**

---

## Overview

This project builds a machine learning model to recognize handwritten digits (0-9) from images. It uses popular datasets and deep learning techniques to achieve high accuracy. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and a simple user interface to test digit recognition in real time.

---

## Features

- **Data:** Uses the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits.
- **Model:** Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow/Keras.
- **Preprocessing:** Image normalization and reshaping.
- **Evaluation:** Accuracy, loss visualization, and confusion matrix.
- **User Interface:** Simple interface to draw digits or upload images for prediction.

## Setup and Usage

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd digit_recognition_project
````

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate     # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Train the model**

```bash
python src/train.py
```

5. **Run the evaluation scripts**

```bash
python src/evaluate.py
```

6. **Launch the user interface**

```bash
streamlit run app/app.py
```

or, if using Tkinter,

```bash
python app/app.py
```

## Dataset

This project uses the popular MNIST dataset of handwritten digits. It consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, each sized 28x28 pixels in grayscale.

---

## Model Architecture

* Input layer: 28x28 grayscale images
* 2–3 convolutional layers with ReLU activation
* MaxPooling layers for downsampling
* Fully connected dense layers
* Output layer with softmax activation for 10 digit classes

---

## Results

* Typical accuracy > 98% on test dataset.
* Visualizations include training/validation accuracy and loss curves, and confusion matrix for model predictions.

---

## Future Enhancements

* Support for colored or larger images.
* Real-time digit recognition from webcam feed.
* Deploy the model as a web API.
* Implement transfer learning with more complex architectures.
